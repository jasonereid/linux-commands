## Basic text editing

vim your-file-name.txt - edits a file in VIM

Once VIM opens, you will be in command mode, not edit mode. To turn on edit mode (and type text), hit the "i" key. You will see --INSERT-- and then you will be able to type and edit the document like any other word processor.
You can also paste in copied text.

Hit the Escape key when you are done editing to go back to command mode.

## File saving

:x - save and exit the file. 
:wq - save and exit the file. 
:w - save file without exiting
:q! - exit without saving

## Navigation

: (a number) - moves the to whatever line number you specify. Example: ":13" takes you to line 13
:0 - moves to beginning of file
:$ - moves to end
b - move to previous word
w - move to next word
